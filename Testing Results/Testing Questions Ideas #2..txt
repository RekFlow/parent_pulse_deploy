DATA from the EXCEL file 

Yes, here are some specific test questions based on the grade data for Samir's Social Studies class:

Test Questions:
1. "What is my current grade in Science?"
2. "What was my score on the Nature of Science Test?"
3. "How did I do on my Lab Safety Poster?"
4. "What's my classwork average?"
5. "What's my homework average?"
6. "How am I doing on quizzes?"
7. "What assignments did I complete in August?"
8. "What was my lowest quiz score?"
9. "What assignments have I gotten 100% on?"
10. "What's my grade on recent bellwork assignments?"

For debugging purposes, try these questions and check:
1. The console logs in the browser dev tools
2. The terminal running your Next.js server
3. The terminal running your Python backend

The responses should include specific grades and scores from the CSV file. For example:
- The overall grade should show as 89 (B)
- The Nature of Science Test score should show as 46/50 (92%)
- The classwork average should be 91%
- The homework average should be 85%
- The quiz average should be 60%

If you're not getting this specific information in the responses, we may need to check:
1. If the CSV file is properly loaded into the Chroma database
2. If the query processing in the Python backend is correctly parsing the grades
3. If the embeddings are properly capturing the grade information

DATA json file structure:

Yes, here are specific test questions based on the science_grades.json file structure:

Test Questions for Grades:
1. "What's my current grade in Science with Ms. Hepp?"
2. "What's my overall term grade?"
3. "How am I doing in Ms. Hepp's class?"

Classwork Questions:
1. "What was my score on the Nature of Science Test?"
2. "How did I do on the Lab Safety Poster?"
3. "What's my grade on the Phet Simulations Radioactive Dating assignment?"

3. "Show me all my homework assignments"
4. "What's my grade on the Syllabus homework?"

Quiz Questions:

Category Analysis:
1. "Which category am I doing best in?"
2. "Show me all my perfect scores"
3. "What assignments do I need to improve on?"
4. "What's my lowest grade so far?"

Each of these questions should return specific data from the JSON file. For example:
- Term grade queries should return "89 B"
- Nature of Science Test queries should return "46/50 points (92%)"
- Lab Safety Poster queries should return "10/10 points (100%)"

This will help verify if the Chroma database is properly processing and returning the correct information from the JSON file.
